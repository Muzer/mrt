Muzer's Rail Timetable
======================

After recent criticism of the National Rail Timetable (NRT), I've decided to
see if I can't write something to generate a better one. I probably can't, but
we'll see. There's not much here at the moment.

The initial work will mostly be with discovery and parsing of the existing
timetable data. After that will be trying to come up with some algorithm to
produce the best combinations of tables (including how to order them,
preferably in a similar manner to the NRT). Then will be introduced various
smaller but important additions, such as being able to manually tweak a
finished timetable to correct errors, and to store a map of tables to ensure
future consistency. Finally, rendering a PDF will be worked on. This idea is
subject to change or complete abandonment!
